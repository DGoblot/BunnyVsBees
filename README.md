# How To Run
The .exe is in Gppbox\x64\Release\BunnyVSBees.exe, make sure that the .exe is in the same folder as everything else in the Release folder !

# Controls
- Move with Q and D
- Jump with SPACE
- Shoot with LeftMouseButton
- Edit level with TAB, click on "Save level" to ..... save the level !
- "Player", "Ennemie" and "Wall" allows you to place stuff, "Empty" removes it (check the ImGui)

# Features
- Move the Bunny around.
- Everything is animated (with 2 frames, but it's more than 1 !)
- Fire a cool weapon, with muzzle fire, recoil, and screen-shaking power !
- Bees are super strong ! One hit, one kill ! But they're kinda dumb and will keep moving until they hit a wall.
- You have a cool friend that follows you around, but is quite useless ...
- Level Editor that is not very efficient but works well, and allows saving. The saved level is loaded when you launch the game.
